# Using WinSCP to transfer files to and from the server

WinSCP is a secure file transfer program that allows users to move files back and forth between Windows desktops and Linux servers. Setting up a WinSCP connection can be a somewhat daunting experience (similar to setting up a PuTTY connection), but once it's done, it should be usable long-term. In order to set up a WinSCP connection, you will need to install WinSCP from the [website here](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php). Once you have the program installed, follow the steps below to set up your connection.
