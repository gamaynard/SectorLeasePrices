# Using WinSCP to transfer files to and from the server

WinSCP is a secure file transfer program that allows users to move files back and forth between Windows desktops and Linux servers. Setting up a WinSCP connection can be a somewhat daunting experience (similar to setting up a PuTTY connection), but once it's done, it should be usable long-term. In order to set up a WinSCP connection, you will need to install WinSCP from the [website here](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php). Once you have the program installed, follow the steps below to set up your connection. 

1. Click on the **NEW SITE** button to create a new session
2. The **File Protocol** and **Port** parameters should already be set to `SFTP` and `22` respectively, so no changes need to be made there. 
3. The **Hostname** is `fisheriestrust.xyz` and the **User name** is `ubuntu`
