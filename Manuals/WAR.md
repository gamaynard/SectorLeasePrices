# Weekly Annual Catch Entitlement Reporting

Each week, the sector is responsible for submitting a report of its current Annual Catch Entitlement (ACE) holdings to the Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office through the SIMM. In order to simplify the process, we developed a simple reporting tool for LEASE ONLY groundfish sectors that uses files downloaded directly from the SIMM along with the previous week's report to generate a report for the current week. 

In order to use the software, you will need to download the setup file [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/weeklyacereporter/files/latest/download). The setup file will walk you through the licensing agreement (this software is open-source and released under the GNU Public License v3, FREE as in FREEDOM) and provide some release information about the software before prompting the user to select an install location. Unpacking and installing the program will take several minutes. Once the program has been installed, you will be prompted to visit this page for the most up to date README. 

Once you've installed the program on your Windows computer, you can run it from the start menu or from the desktop shortcut. On running the software you will be prompted to indicate whether you want to apply in season adjustments to quota. This may be necessary once or twice early in the year as GARFO finalizes carry over amounts and ACE allocations. If you press "1" to indicate "yes", you will be prompted to enter an adjustment amount (in lbs) for each stock. 

After completing the in season adjustments prompt, you will be prompted to load last week's report through a pop-up, file selection menu.
