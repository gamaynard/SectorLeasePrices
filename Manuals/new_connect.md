# Creating a new connection to an AWS server

This process may seem a little intimidating, but you only need to do it once to set up a connection between a windows machine and the server. 

1. Download the PuTTY terminal emulator program [here](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty-64bit-0.74-installer.msi) and install it on your Windows machine. *NOTE: If the linked installer for Windows 10 64-bit systems doesn't work on your PC, you can select the appropriate installer from the list [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)*
2. Log in to the AWS Management Console with the CCCFA credentials and select the EC2 option.
